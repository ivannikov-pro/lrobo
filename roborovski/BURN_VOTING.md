Hey @Robo Adopter üêπ !

Voting will last for 14 days so more holders can participate. From September 12 until September 26. 
To make it fair we will allow all holders to give their vote ( muted once also) and to make the voting transparent we will close new holders registration for that period of time.

Road 1Ô∏è‚É£ : 
As we commented on our last AMAs about the current situation of the film industry especially in the animation division, 
we were trying to find another solution but with the same core idea, creating the animation series. 
By going through many materials and talking with knowledgeable people in this area, 
we think that the best solution is to create a Social Media Animation Series ( YouTube, TikTok and Instagram ).

Because the creation of this type of animation is faster and cheaper and the most important can have cash flow going in a shorter period of time. 
As an example we want you to have a look at: Simon¬¥s Cat, Nobody Sausage or TheOdd1sOut. 
We believe this type of pivot will bring more passionate followers to our project and will make it more popular. 
We will laser focus only on this task to make it as good as possible.

Road 2Ô∏è‚É£:
We see that many holders of the project would like to burn their NFTs in exchange for ETH from the rest of the project contract. 
That means you will get 0,05Eth based on the calculation, for each Roborovski NFT you burn. After that the project will be officially closed.
